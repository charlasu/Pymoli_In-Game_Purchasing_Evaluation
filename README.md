# Pymoli_In-Game_Purchasing_Evaluation
Evaluating in-game purchases by gender, age, item popularity, and item revenue.

Although it's easy to assume that a game will attract male players of a certain age, it's only a hypothesis until the data proves it to be so. Looking at unique users (as well as users with multiple screennames), gender, age, and purchases, we can find trends that may help the producer of the game to adjust marketing to better attract users of a different age and/or gender, or to redirect resources to help increase game-profitablity. Let's look at these results.

# Overview
This chart shows that there are only 780 purchases yet 179 unique items have been sold. My question for the game producer is *how many resource hours did it take to create and build these in-game items?* Later in this report, there will be numbers for the Most Profitable itemsâ€”and even these top 5 items only account for less than 2% of sales each.

# Gender
Not surprisingly, the game skews heavily male; however, of 14.49% of the Pymoli audience as female. 

Additionally for Pymoli, the average purchase price by female players is higher than male players, meaning $.18 more gross revenue on each purchase. 

There is a marketing opportunity to increase the number of players by focusing reach on women. Studies show that women are increasingly getting to parity with men in the overall game-play world, making up 48% of the overall audience all the way back in 2013.

Based on this data, by focusing on bringing more women into the game, this should increase the game producer's bottome line.
